# MKI2025_Odyssey

This robot was designed to compete in the 2025 FRC competition: Reefscape. The robot was designed on Solidworks after synthesizing the ideas of over a 100 students, which we organize as "Needs", "Wants", and "Nice to Haves". Specific information of the design can be found in the "Behind the Design" pdf.
